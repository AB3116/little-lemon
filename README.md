## App Features
`Responsive Design:` The "Little Lemon" web app is fully responsive. It adapts to different screen sizes, allowing users to access and interact with the booking system seamlessly.

`Local Storage:` The app stores booked data in the browser's local storage. To check the stored data, follow these steps:

Open the developer tools in your browser (usually done by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
Navigate to the "Application" or "Storage" tab in the developer tools.
Expand the "Local Storage" section.
Look for the entry related to the "Little Lemon" app to view the stored data.

`Multi-Step React Form:` The booking form in the app is implemented as a multi-step form using React. It guides the user through a series of steps to complete the booking process. The state of the form is managed using the Context API, which allows for efficient state management across multiple components.
